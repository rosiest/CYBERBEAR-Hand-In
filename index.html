							<h1>Ideation</h1>
							<p>Following my concept from Project One, I’ve decided to go forth with the basis of my idea. This includes implementing everything discussed, which are mainly the introduction of basic information on cybercrime & cybersecurity and an additional website checker that checks if a website is safe or not from a pasted URL. I’ve also decided to keep the colour scheme, logos and typeface the same.</p>

							<p>For prototyping, I’m probably going to use Figma as I’ve recently learnt how to use that this trimester and it would be useful to get used to the program. The software is great for prototyping and I think it would be easy to take advantage of the features.</p>
						
							<p>I plan to follow through with my wireframes but refine them to be more functional and look more suitable for a website. This could involve changing sizes, playing around with buttons and exploring these areas for my prototype.</p>
							
							<p>Another thing I’d like to consider is adding more information around “CyberWorld”, where I’d add a special top 10 tips or rules when it comes to internet safety. This will either be an additional page or at the bottom of the page so users can scroll to access it.</p>
						
							<p>One thing I’d like to implement in my prototype is hover-state buttons. I think it would be great to use this for some interaction.</p>
					
							<p>Also, another idea is to have a start-up page that features a button that enters the website. I’ll probably start with this for the prototyping process.</p>

							<h1>What is Cyber Crime?</h1>
							<p>Cybercrime is defined as a crime where a computer is the object of the crime or is used as a tool to commit an offence. A cybercriminal may use a device to access a user’s personal information, confidential business information, government information, or disable a device. It is also a cybercrime to sell or elicit the above information online.

							Cybercrimes can generally be divided into two categories:
							Crimes that target networks or devices such as viruses, malware and DoS attacks and crimes using devices to participate in criminal activities, such as phishing emails, cyberstalking and identity theft.</p>
							
							<h1>What is Cyber Security?</h1>
							<p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes. Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative.</p>
